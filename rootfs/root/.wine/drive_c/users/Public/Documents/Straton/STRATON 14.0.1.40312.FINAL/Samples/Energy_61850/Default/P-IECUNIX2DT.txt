Extract date from UNIX timestamp
DST: when set to TRUE, add one hour for Day Saving Time
UTC is the time zone (For example 1 for Paris, 0 for UTC)

Caution with DST behaviour :
DST = TRUE means it will offset one hour
DST = FALSE means it will not offset one hour
The information of if a we are in summer is NOT extracted from the timestamp input. 
This information should have been stored with the timestamp in a separate boolean.

IMPORTANT!
Due to the computing of LREAL, precision for milliseconds is +/- 0.001
 Ex. 0.748 in LREAL may be displayed '747' on the MILLISECONDS output
